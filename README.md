# GUI-Labyrint-Game

The main task is to find ways out of a maze.  The constructor reads the file and creates the data structure 
with the two-dimensional array and all the Rute objects based on the data in the file.

With a given start point, the peogramm will find all ways out and print it out on the terminal.
It Uses Java with AWT + Swing to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the labyrinth program.
